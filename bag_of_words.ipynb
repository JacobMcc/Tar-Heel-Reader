Columbus made a big impact because he made Europe and the rest of the world aware of vast new continents. In fourteen hundred and ninety two Columbus sailed the ocean blue. He returned again in 1493, 1498, and 1502 but he never found a route to the West Indies. And on October 12, one of his crew members spotted land.

He searched high and low for some acorns to store for the winter in his tree. But there were no acorns in sight. The squirrel could feel a cold breeze on his tail. Winter was coming!
